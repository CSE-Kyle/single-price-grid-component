## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS

### What I learned :

how to make a website responsive by the use of "media queries" to style how the structure of a website should look depending on its screen size.
```css
  @media only screen and (max-width: 541px) {
  }
```

### Continued development

- How to better position/align elements in an efficient way and not over using too many properties and creating too many classes to accomplish certain tasks.
- setting font size for text by using rem to keep consistent font styling. 

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - The main resource that I've used to figure out how to style and position elements on the webpage.

- [Wes Bos CSS Grid](https://cssgrid.io/) - A video series that has helped me be more comfortable of using CSS Grid, I was very rusty on grid before jumping into watching the video series and it has aided me a lot to have a better understanding of how grid works and how to use it.
